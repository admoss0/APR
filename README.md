# APR
The Australian Politics Resource
APR is a websit that aims to provide complete, comprehensive and unbiased information about Australian politics.
The first site of its kind on the Internet, APR was active from 1995 until 2001 and attracted over a million visitors per year.
This project will reboot APR in 2025 as a Blazor web application with modern interactive content.
